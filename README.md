# Theme BRG

This is my base theme for WordPress sites. It uses AJAX requests to load more results for the archives

## Settings

In the theme settings there are a couple things to set:

* A list of post types, and what style to display them as. 
* A list of colors for the theme

## Filters

* `brg/displayed_member_fields`: returns array of ACF field slugs which are displayed on the user account pages.
